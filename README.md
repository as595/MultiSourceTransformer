### Multi-source data in radio astronomy

An example of multi-source data in radio astronomy: the same radio galaxy seen by the LOFAR telescope at a frequency of 144 MHz (left), as seen by the VLA telescope in BnC configuration (FIRST Survey) at a frequency of 1.4 GHz (centre), and as seen by the VLA telescope in D configuration (NVSS Survey) at a frequency of 1.4 GHz (right). The images differ by more than resolution - there is unique information in each one.
